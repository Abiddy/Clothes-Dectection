# Clothes Detection

Image segmentation can be largely improved by integrating
neural network models with image processing tools like
grab-cut algorithm
Segmentation can be made much easier using mask R-CNN
since it automatically develops a pixel-wise mask around the
subject of an image. Thereby separating the foreground from
the background.Mask R-CNN is a widely used deep learning
for training and testing datasets and models. The goal is
to use the neural network model to obtain better segmentation.
